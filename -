WDD231 Project Proposal
Adam Cottam – Nov 17, 2025
 Project Subject Family Adventures in America’s National Parks  Project Description My website will be a “Family Adventure Planner” for U.S. National Parks. It will highlight several parks from different regions of the country and explain why each one is great for families. The site will share kid-friendly hikes and activities, must-see viewpoints, basic itineraries, and simple planning tips such as when to visit, what to pack, and safety reminders. As the course progresses, I plan to use JSON data from public APIs (like the National Park Service API) to dynamically display park information.
Project Reason and Purpose I chose this subject because some of my best memories are road-tripping with my family and exploring National Parks together. To me, these parks really capture some of the best things about America: big views, quiet trails, and time to unplug as a family. I also know that planning a park trip can feel overwhelming if you are not sure where to start. The purpose of my site is to give families a simple place to explore park options, see what might fit their interests, and pick up practical tips so they can spend less time stressing over logistics and more time enjoying the experience together.
